I graduated as a mathematician, originally interested in algebraic geometric (see e.g. one of my projects on [mathbb.com](https://mathbb.com/){:target="_blank"}). Since 2015 I have been working as a research engineer at [**DeepMind**](https://www.deepmind.com){:target="_blank"} in Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence. I have worked in health research with a focus on clinically applicable, high impact research work in several domains. I am also interested in general representation learning (e.g., generative models and self-supervised learning).
On the side, I am also interested in startups and investing.
