I graduated as a mathematician, originally interested in algebraic geometric and now working in Machine Learning / AI. From 2015 until 2021 I worked as a research engineer at [**DeepMind**](https://www.deepmind.com){:target="_blank"} where I've lead several high impact projects. I have worked in health research with a focus on clinically applicable, high impact research work in several domains as well as representation learning research and some reinforcement learning.
On the side, I am also interested in startups and investing.
